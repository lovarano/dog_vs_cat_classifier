# dog_vs_cat_classifier

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This project comes out of my nanodegree for Artificial Intelligence at Udacity. I completed the code for a pretrained 
classifier. The classifier is able to classify dogs and cats. It can be used with 3 different CNN Model Architecture: VGG, ALEXNET and RESNET.</p>
<p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<li>Copy all files to a desidered folder</li>
<li>Upload dog or cat images to folder <strong>uploaded_images</strong></li>
<li>Open a CLI and navigate to file classifier.py</li>
<li>Run this file with arguments, e.g.: python classifier.py --arch VGG --dir uploaded_images</li>
<br>Arguments that can passed are: --arch | --dir | dogfile*
<p>*the file that contains the list of valid dognames</p>
